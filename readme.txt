1. Make sure all requirements from the requirements.txt file are available in environment
2. Run the notebooks Catboostv2, LGBMv2 and finally Stackfull
	Note: In all these there is a DATA_PATH variable at the top to tell where to look for the data. Replace it with your local path to data.
3. You can keep running Catboost and LGBM with different seeds (change at the top) to increase the stack performance.
